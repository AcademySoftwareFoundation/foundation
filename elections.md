## Nominations

Nominations are done via email. Members of the electorate group may nominate someone else in the electorate group or self-nominate. All nominations must include the nomineeâ€™s name, company affiliation, and a short background on the nominee and why they wish to serve in the role. All nominations are confirmed before the election.

## Elections

The Academy Software Foundation uses [LFX PCC Voting]([https://opavote.com](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center/v2-latest-version/collaborations/voting)) for the election process. Electorates will be sent an email with the complete list of nominees to review and a separate email from LFX PCC Voting with a unique link to submit their ballot. Voting will be done using the checkbox method; electors will checkbox the individual(s) they wish to elect.
