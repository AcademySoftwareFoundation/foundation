# ASWF Digital Assets License

This folder contains a license for use with assets intended to be used solely for any of the following purposes:

- education
- training
- research
- software and hardware development
- performance benchmarking (including publication of benchmark results and permitting reproducibility of the benchmark results by third parties)
- software and hardware product demonstrations.

## History

The latest version of the ASWF Digital Assets License is version 1.1.

- [Version 1.1](aswf_digital_assets_license_v1.1.txt) of this license was approved for use by the Academy Software Foundation Governing Board on 2022-02-22.
- [Version 1.0](aswf_digital_assets_license_v1.0.txt) of this license was approved for use by the Academy Software Foundation Governing Board on 2021-07-29.

This license is available to be used by both ASWF and non-ASWF projects.

## License Notices

When releasing assets under this license, be sure to replace the angle bracketed sections in the header of the template (`<Asset Name>`, `<Year>`, `<Asset Owner>`) with the applicable information for your asset. You may wish to consult with your own legal counsel if you have questions about the specific details to include.

Assets should include language within their metadata indicating the use of this license and pointing to the full license text using the URL format `https://aswf.io/licenses/aswf_digital_assets_license_vx.y.txt` with `x` being the major version number and `y` being the minor version number. Example below:

```
Released under the ASWF Digital Assets License v1.0 (available at https://aswf.io/licenses/aswf_digital_assets_license_v1.1.txt)
```

The ASWF Digital Assets licenses have been added to the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses) (both [v1.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/ASWF-Digital-Assets-1.0.html) and [v1.1](https://spdx.org/licenses/ASWF-Digital-Assets-1.1.html)), so you can also use a [short-form SPDX License Identifier](https://spdx.dev/ids), such as the following:
  
```
SPDX-License-Identifier: ASWF-Digital-Assets-1.1
```

## FAQ

**Q1: How is the v1.0 License different from v1.1?**

A1: The only difference is in the obligation in clause 1:

> Redistributions of these digital assets or any part of them must include the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the disclaimer below ***, and if applicable, a description of how the redistributed versions of the digital assets differ from the originals***.

**Q2: The Licenses mention “training” in their lists of permitted uses. Does this refer to “training” an AI model?**

A2: No. When the Licenses were developed, discussed and published by the ASWF community in 2021 and 2022, the word “training” was discussed in the context of human-based training. This is reflected in the fact that “training” appears immediately following “education.”

“Training” here was intended to permit use of assets distributed under these licenses, for example, to enable individual persons (even those employed by other companies) to experiment and work with the assets in connection with training and learning how to use software tools to manipulate those asset files.

This reflects the intent of the Licenses’ drafters. Training an AI model was not in scope for what the ASWF community had intended when drafting the Licenses.

**Q3: So if I use assets provided under one of the Licenses to train an AI model, does that mean that I would be violating the license?**

A3: Not necessarily. The answer here is likely going to depend on the specifics of your use case.

As described in A2 above, the ASWF community’s drafters of the Licenses did not intend that the word “training” was referring to AI model training. However, other parts of the license permission grant might independently permit training an AI model in some contexts.

For example, the Licenses also permit using the assets for “*research, software and hardware development, [or] performance benchmarking*” (in each case, subject to complying with the obligations in clauses 1 through 4). Training certain types of AI models *might* be permissible in these contexts. Potential examples could include training an AI model on the licensed assets for purposes such as:

* where the model’s outputs are used solely as part of testing or benchmarking one’s own software tools; or
* where the model’s outputs are entirely different in kind and nature from the original assets (e.g., generating outputs which have no reasonable possibility of re-creating the original assets or a meaningful substitute for them).

By contrast, using the assets to train an AI model is less likely to be permissible, if it generates outputs which are essentially functional equivalents of the inputs, or which essentially preserve and reproduce the assets’ underlying creative intent. For instance, if an AI model trained on assets received under the Licenses is capable of generating copies of or equivalent replacements for those assets, then it may be more likely to stretch beyond the intended scope of the Licenses’ permission grants.

Please be aware that, as of late 2025, several AI-related court cases are in process in various jurisdictions. Some of these may address whether a recipient of certain materials needs explicit permission to use them to train an AI model. This FAQ is not trying to answer that question. We’re only addressing our view of what the ASWF Digital Asset licenses themselves are intended to permit.

Finally, please keep in mind that we are unable to provide you with legal advice for your particular situation. If you are wondering whether your use case is on-sides or more likely to go beyond the Licenses’ scope, please consult your own legal counsel. The comments above are intended to reflect the general intent of certain members of the ASWF community, but this does not mean that every licensor using one of the Licenses will share these perspectives.
